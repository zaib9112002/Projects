      Calculator Web Application using Servlet and JSP

A basic web-based calculator developed using Java Servlets and JSP that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates form handling, request dispatching, and backend processing using the Servlet-JSP model.

📌 Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a calculator that:

Accepts two numeric inputs from the user html

Performs basic arithmetic operations

Displays the result on a dynamic JSP page

The goal is to demonstrate how Servlet and JSP can work together to build a dynamic web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

🔑 Features:
➕ Addition
➖ Subtraction
✖️ Multiplication
➗ Division
🔄 Real-time result display using JSP output

⚙️ Technologies Used:
Component	Technology
Language	Java
Backend	Servlet API
View	JSP (Java Server Pages) and HTML(HyperText Markup Language)
Architecture	MVC (Model-View-Controller)
Server	Apache Tomcat
Build Tool	Eclipse

📂 Project Structure
create a project
CalculatorApp/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com.example.calculator/
│   │   │       └── CalculatorServlet.java (Servlet)
│   │   └── webapp/
│   │       ├── calculator.html
│   │       └── result.jsp
├── WEB-INF/
│   └── web.xml

📜 How It Works:
User enters two numbers and selects an operation on calculator.html

Form submits data to CalculatorServlet

Servlet performs the operation and forwards result to result.jsp

JSP page dynamically displays the result

📚 How to Run the Project
1.Set up Tomcat on your machine
2.Clone the repository:
      https://github.com/yourusername/CalculatorApp.git
3.Import the project into your Java IDE (Eclipse) as a Dynamic Web Project
4.Deploy the project to Apache Tomcat server
5.Access the application at:
  http://localhost:8080/CalculatorApp/

✅ Sample Operation
Input:

Number 1: 20
Number 2: 5
Operation: Division
Output: Result: 4.0
